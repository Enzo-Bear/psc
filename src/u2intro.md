        <h1>Unit 2 - Networks Standards and Compliance</h1>
    </p>
</div>

## Overview

Understanding and implementing network standards and compliance measures can make security controls of critical importance very effective.

* This unit introduces foundational knowledge on analyzing, configuring, and hardening networking components using tools and frameworks like STIGs, OpenSCAP, and DNS configurations.
## Learning Objectives  

1. Identifying and analyzing STIGs related to Linux networking.

2. Understand and configure secure name resolution using nsswitch.conf and DNS.

3. Utilizing tools like tcpdump, ngrep, ss, and netstat to monitor network behavior.

4. Applying OpenSCAP and SCC tools for network compliance assessments.

5. Exploring known network-based exploits and understanding their anatomy via the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis.

## Relevance and Context

* Networks represent one of the most common attack vectors in enterprise systems. Misconfigured name resolution, open ports, and insecure protocols are all doorways to intrusion. As system engineers, building resilient systems requires a deep understanding of how data flows through these pathways and what tools can monitor and secure them.

* By learning to assess and remediate network-related STIGs and implementing structured standards, students will gain the skills to reduce ingress risk and respond effectively to threats. These skills are not only crucial for compliance but also for real-world defense.

## Prerequisites

1. Linux command-line networking tools (ss, netstat, tcpdump, ngrep)
